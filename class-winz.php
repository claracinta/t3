/**
 * @mainpage OMP API Reference Documentation
 *
 * Welcome to the comprehensive OMP (Open Monograph Press) API Reference. 
 * This document is an essential resource that provides detailed, 
 * automatically generated documentation derived directly from the source code 
 * of the OMP system. Its purpose is to help developers and maintainers understand 
 * the internal workings of OMP, a sophisticated platform for managing scholarly 
 * monographs in a flexible, maintainable, and robust way.
 *
 * OMP's architecture is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, 
 * adhering to proven software design principles such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
 * pattern. This approach ensures clear separation of concerns, making the system 
 * highly adaptable to evolving requirements, while maintaining ease of use 
 * and reliability. Anyone familiar with Sun's Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 
 * technology or MVC-based frameworks will quickly recognize many similarities 
 * in OMP's architecture.
 *
 * The MVC pattern is fundamental in structuring OMP into clearly defined layers, 
 * each responsible for distinct aspects of the system’s operation. This separation 
 * ensures that data management, user interface, and control logic remain 
 * independent from one another, simplifying development and maintenance.
 *
 * In this layered architecture, the key components of OMP, roughly ordered 
 * from the front-end (user interaction) to the back-end (data handling and storage), include:
 *
 * - **Smarty templates**: These are responsible for assembling HTML pages to present 
 *   to users. The templates handle the front-end display logic, ensuring a clean 
 *   and consistent user experience across the platform. By leveraging the Smarty 
 *   templating engine, developers can separate presentation logic from the underlying 
 *   PHP code, making it easier to update and maintain the user interface.
 *
 * - **Page classes**: These classes act as the intermediaries between the user's 
 *   browser and the system’s internal logic. They receive HTTP requests from 
 *   the browser, delegate the necessary processing to other components such as 
 *   controllers or action classes, and ultimately pass the relevant data to Smarty 
 *   templates to generate the final HTML response. Page classes ensure smooth 
 *   communication between the user interface and the underlying application logic.
 *
 * - **Controllers**: Reusable components that encapsulate logic for handling 
 *   common tasks, such as AJAX requests or other specialized subrequests. 
 *   These controllers are designed to be reusable across different sections 
 *   of the application, minimizing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.
 *
 * - **Action classes**: These are used by Page classes to perform complex 
 *   business logic or non-trivial operations in response to user requests. 
 *   Action classes typically handle tasks such as form validation, complex 
 *   data processing, or triggering system events based on user interactions.
 *
 * - **Model classes**: These represent the core entities within the system. 
 *   For example, classes such as `User`, `Monograph`, and `Press` encapsulate 
 *   the data structures and business logic associated with each entity. 
 *   The model layer ensures a clear separation between the raw data (as stored 
 *   in the database) and the application's business logic.
 *
 * - **Data Access Objects (DAOs)**: These classes are responsible for handling 
 *   database interactions. They provide methods for creating, reading, updating, 
 *   and deleting records associated with the system's Model classes. DAOs 
 *   abstract the details of database communication, allowing developers 
 *   to interact with data in a consistent, high-level way without needing 
 *   to write SQL queries directly. Typically, DAOs follow consistent naming 
 *   conventions, making it easy to identify their purpose and role within 
 *   the system. For instance, a class responsible for managing `Monograph` 
 *   data would typically be named `MonographDAO`.
 *
 * - **Support classes**: These provide various core functionalities that 
 *   support the system's operation. This can include utility classes 
 *   for common tasks like logging, session management, or date handling. 
 *   Support classes are designed to be modular and reusable, ensuring 
 *   that common functionalities are implemented in a consistent and 
 *   maintainable way across the entire system.
 *
 * OMP’s architecture relies heavily on inheritance and a consistent naming 
 * convention, making it easier for developers to understand the role of each class 
 * and how they fit into the broader system. For example, a DAO class 
 * will always inherit from the base `DAO` class and will have a name 
 * in the form `[Entity]DAO`, with corresponding files typically named 
 * `[Entity]DAO.inc.php`. This naming structure simplifies navigation 
 * and enhances code readability, allowing developers to quickly locate 
 * the relevant files and understand their responsibilities.
 *
 * To assist developers further, OMP provides several additional resources 
 * for learning and troubleshooting:
 *
 * - **The docs/README document**: This document provides a high-level 
 *   overview of the system, including installation instructions, configuration 
 *   options, and other important information.
 *
 * - **The PKP support forum** at https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca: A community-driven 
 *   forum where developers and users can ask questions, share knowledge, 
 *   and find solutions to common issues.
 *
 * - **Documentation available at** https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/: This site 
 *   contains a wealth of detailed technical documentation for OMP and 
 *   other PKP (Public Knowledge Project) applications. Developers can 
 *   find guides, API references, and other useful materials to help 
 *   them contribute to or customize the system.
